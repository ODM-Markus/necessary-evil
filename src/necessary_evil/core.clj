  call*
  "Does a syncronous http request to the server and method provided.

   call* allows more control over how the call is sent to the endpoint server.
   Note that unlike call, call* takes a seq for args rather than as varags.

   Optional keyword arguments:
     post-fn - this function does the actual http request. Must take the same
       arguments as clj-http's post function. This is to allow you supply additional
       middleware etc that may be required for your particular needs.

     request - a map of all the request arguments as specified by clj-http. Any
       values provided here will override the defaults with the exception of :body
       which is (unsurprisingly) provided by call*

   See https://github.com/dakrone/clj-http/ for more details.
