(ns necessary-evil.methodcall
  "This module implements the methodCall wire format portion of the
   XML-RPC spec. You can find the official spect at
   http://www.xml-rpc.com/spec.

   It is expected that this module will always be required, rather than used.
   The parse function will consume a clojure.xml structure and return a
   MethodCall record. The unparse function is the dual of parse; it takes a
   MethodCall record and returns xml.

   Use clojure.xml/emit to turn the xml structure returned into text. As emit
   prints to *out* you may need to use with-out-str to capture the result.
